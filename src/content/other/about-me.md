Hi. I'm Henning. This is my website. There is not a lot going on yet. But that will change. Or not. Because life, you know.

This site will be a blog, mainly. I like to write. Sometimes, when I feel preposterous, I even call myself a writer. There were times when I would call myself a screenwriter. I don't know about that now. But what I _do_ know: I like to make things. And this site is one of these things.

I'm coding it myself. If stuff isn't working, it's probably my fault, so let me know.

Anyway, in the future this will also be a place where I offer process-oriented coaching for screenwriters and other creatives. I haven't fully figured out what that means yet. You can read my (only) blog post for more thoughts on process-oriented creativity.

If you are interested in that or in anything else you find on here, let me know!

You can't let me know at the moment because I haven't added a way to contact me. Guess you have to come back then. See you around!
